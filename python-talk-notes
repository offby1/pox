What features of Python have I used while fumbling with this?

- functions, obviously
- classes, obviously
- pprint module
- dicts
- if statement
- comments
- log module
- string formatting
- lists

I note that the whole design of of_tutorial.py is side-effecty, which is a shame.

- Repl!!
- print with "dir" and "vars" (what's the difference, anyway?)
- modules & imports

https://github.com/mininet/mininet/wiki/Introduction-to-Mininet#useful-background-for-using-mininet
contains a similar list of concepts.
